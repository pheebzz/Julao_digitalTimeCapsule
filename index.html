                <h3>THE GODS IN COUNCIL-MINERVA'S VISIT TO ITHACA</h3>
                     <h4>THE CHALLENGE FROM TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS</h4>
                            <p> Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked <em>the famous town of Troy.</em> 
                                Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; 
                                moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; 
                                <em>but do what he might</em> he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle 
                                    of <strong>the Sun-god Hyperion</strong>; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things,
                                        <strong>oh daughter of Jove</strong>, from whatsoever source you may know them.</p>
                            <p> So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except <strong>Ulysses</strong>, and he, 
                                though he was longing to return to his wife and country, was detained by <strong>the goddess Calypso</strong>, 
                                who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods 
                                settled that he should go back to <em>Ithaca</em>; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over; 
                                nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except <strong>Neptune</strong>, who <em>still</em> persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home.</p>
