                <p>Hi my name is Phoebe Julao. My birthday is on January 24th and I'm an Aquarius. 
                    I was born and raised in San Francisco. I also moved around the Bay growing up, 
                    living in places like South San Francisco and San Mateo. I currently live in 
                    Hercules with my dog, Hiero.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm a Visual Communications Design major at SFSU. I enjoy mixed media art such as painting, sculpture,
                    and black and white photography. My digital time capsule is a glimpse of my existence in my little 
                    corner of the digital world, where everyday apps and media play a daily role in my life as a design student.
                    Though I have many interests and activities I like, this website is a base illustration of what keeps me 
                    creative, motivated, and mostly relaxed. Feel free to click on the other tabs and check out more.

                    Let's talk about the fuel that powers up my brain: coffee (and a few beverages I like for variety and good measure.)
                    I definitely hydrate with lots of water, but if I need a boost of energy knowing the type of day ahead of me I'll
                    use these apps to order these my usual go-to options. I love iced coffee or cold drinks to keep me awake. Beverage tech is a true gift, with rewards and order and pay 
                    options while I'm brainstorming on my design projects.
