                <p><strong>Spotify</strong> has a great selection of media to listen to. Phoebe likes listening to bsd.u Radio for his chill lo-fi
                    beats. Phoebe tends to listen to upbeat but also calming rhythms. Phoebe really likes the daylist options that the Spotify app 
                    offers. She likes how the app remembers certain types of songs and then curates a playlist for her. Phoebe also utilizes listening
                    to podcasts and audiobooks on Spotify. Her choices regarding Spotify media reflect a core personality trait in Phoebe's personal and digital existence which is to always find something good 
                    and simple to unwind with.

                    <p> <strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong> is a program that Phoebe is learning to use to edit her personal photos and interests. Using Lightroom is different from when she used to develop natural photos in a actual 
                        dark room, but this program is another free digital canvas for Phoebe to learn about imagery and perspective. While Phoebe does mostly use 
                        the Adobe apps for school related projects, she also thinks they're fun to explore leisurely.
                    </p>   
                        <strong>Pinterest</strong> is An app that Phoebe always has in her digital rotation. She has built a daily habit now of just of randomly scrolling on Pinterest just to see color combinations and abstract art. Phoebe relies on these media habits for creative juice 
                        and helps her out of artists block. Phoebe admittedly knows she has much to learn to thrive as a creative, but remains grateful that there are many 
                        programs like these that support her visionary flow and artistic identity.
