                <p>Spotify has a great selection of media to listen to. I enjoy listening to podcasts and audiobooks during 
                    my drive to campus. I tend to listen to more instrumental music in the background while doing projects. </p>
                <h2>Adobe Creative & Pinterest</h2>
                <img src="img/adobecolor.png" alt="Adobe Color palettes">
                <img src="img/lightroom.png" alt="Adobe Lightroom">
                <p>While I do use the Adobe apps for projects, I also think they're fun to explore leisurely. I tend to browse
                    color palette inspirations regularly and use Lightroom to edit my personal photos of interest. Pinterest is
                    one of my favorite apps to use. Here is a random screenshot of my daily feed. I have a habit now of just
                    randomly scrolling on Pinterest just to see color combinations and abstract art. Theres always something new
                    to find and inspiration to create.
