                        <h4>Yayoi Kusama is a legend in contemporary art, minimalism, and abstract expressionism. 
                        She's best known for her infinite polka dot installations. I'm inspired by how she 
                        has made her deep-rooted personal experiences into honest, memorable, and authentic artwork.

                        <h4>Reina Koyano's "Sole Fatale" illustrations depict reinterpretations of sneaker silhouettes
                        into powerful women. From a career standpoint she motivates me to draw inspiration from what I enjoy during my
                        art and design progression.

                        <h4>Toshiyuki Inoko is the founder of teamLab Art Collective, a collaborative group of artists in animation, architecuture
                        and other various technology mediums to create art through digital technology. The art exhibitions in Japan 
                        introduce Interconnected Reality, which utilizes large physical spaces where people can interact with 
                        the digital art. Their exhibitions give me color inspiration through their vibrant and striking illusions.
