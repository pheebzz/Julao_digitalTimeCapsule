                <p><strong> Phoebe is a variety gamer and plays different genres of games through consoles and pc.</strong> She finds joy through games 
                    that allow the player to create and customize their characters or create environments like an entire island on 
                    Animal Crossing New Horizons on Nintendo Switch. Displayed is a tier list for Villagers that is updated every month 
                    and voted by the Animal Crossing community. Phoebe also plays FPS games very casually grouped up with 
                    friends or cousins, and for her it's nice to have that adrenaline rush from gaming at times to occupy some time 
                    while online as well.
