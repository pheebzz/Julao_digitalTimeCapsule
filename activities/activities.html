                    she likes to watch. More than likely Phoebe usually watches comfort shows she's watched a lot before or something that makes her laugh.  
                    Phoebe tends to browse through many apps and finds shows or movies that keeps her engaged through 
                    plot twists or appealing character developments.

                        <strong>Phoebe is a variety gamer and plays different genres of games through consoles and pc.</strong> She finds joy through games 
                        that allow the player to create and customize their characters or create environments like an entire island on 
                        Animal Crossing New Horizons on Nintendo Switch. Displayed is a link also for a tier list of Animal Crossing Villagers that is updated every month 
                        and voted by the Animal Crossing community which Phoebe participates in. Phoebe also plays FPS games very casually grouped up with 
                        friends or cousins, and for her it's nice to have that adrenaline rush from gaming at times to occupy some time 
                        while online as well.
