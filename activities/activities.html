                <p>Glad to see you're still here, this is the chill page. After all of the work, its only right to relax 
                    and tune into a streaming site for shows and movies. Phoebe uses a variety of subscription based apps
                    like Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Max, for a wide range of programs she likes to watch. 
                    Phoebe may enjoy watching something as wholesome and nostalgic as <em>Friends</em> but also has time 
                    for action movie plots like <em>Bullet Train.</em> Her mood interest varies and changes often, 
                    and Phoebe tends to browse through many apps but eventually settles on watching something that either makes her
                    laugh or keeps her engaged through plot twists or appealing character developments. If you browse in detail, you'll
                    catch her interests in genres like food, suspense, fantasy, animation, and cute animals. All of the tv shows, anime, and
                    movies displayed on this page are on Phoebe's bookmarked lists on each respective streaming app and she makes use
                    of them on all streaming devices like her tv, mobile, or desktop.

                <p>Phoebe is a variety gamer and plays different genres of games through consoles and pc. She finds joy through games 
                    that allow the player to create and customize their characters or create environments like an entire island on 
                    Animal Crossing New Horizons on Nintendo Switch. Displayed is a tier list for Villagers that is updated every month 
                    and voted by the Animal Crossing community. She likes the portability that the Switch console provides and the 
                    Phoebe has played games like Animal Crossing because they're cozy and she has spent lots of free time creating 
                    custom pieces for her personal enjoyment. Phoebe also plays FPS games very casually grouped up with 
                    friends or cousins, and for her it's nice to have that adrenaline rush from gaming at times to occupy some time 
                    while online as well.
